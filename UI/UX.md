## Overview
**Purpose:** Provide a secure, lightweight, and high-speed mobile app experience for remote internet sharing between Hosts and Connectors.

**Goals:**
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- High trust and security cues
- Delightful microinteractions and gamification

**Target Users:** Students, remote workers, friends sharing internet remotely.

---

## Navigation
**Bottom Navigation Bar (Role-Specific):**
- **Host:** Home, Connections, Notifications, Settings
- **Connector:** Home, Connect, Notifications, Settings

**Top Bar / App Bar:**
- Dynamic per screen, with primary action button (e.g., "Share Internet", "Reconnect", "Approve All").

---

## Screen-by-Screen Design

### Home / Dashboard
**Host:**
- Top bar -> "Host Dashboard" + Share Internet toggle
- Active connections card -> animated bandwidth/latency graph
- Empty state -> "No connections yet. Share your ID to get started."
- Success state -> "All set! You are connected [Success]"

**Connector:**
- Top bar -> "Connector Dashboard" + Reconnect action
- Status card -> Connected / Not Connected + latency/data mini-widgets
- Empty state -> "Enter a Host ID or Scan QR to start"

---

### Connections (Host Only)
- Device list -> staggered fade-in animation
- Approve/Reject -> swipe gestures (right = approve, left = reject) + visual cues
- Undo action -> snackbar: "Rejected. Undo?"
- Empty state -> "Nobody connected. Share your code to invite."

---

### Connect (Connector Only)
- Top bar -> "Find a Host" + QR scan shortcut
- Input field + recent hosts (chips with slide-in animation)
- Connecting -> animated ring / progress indicator
- Success -> glow burst + confirmation microcopy: "Connected! [Success]"
- Error -> animated broken Wi-Fi icon + retry button

---

### Notifications / Activity
- Timeline -> requests, usage alerts, approvals
- New notifications drop-in animation
- Clear all -> collapse animation
- Empty state -> "You are all caught up [Success]"

---

### Settings / Profile
- Sections -> Profile (avatar), Preferences, Security, Friend List
- Friend List -> expandable accordion
- Theme toggle -> Light / Dark mode
- Optional subtle sound toggle

---

### Connection Details
- Header -> Connector name + Disconnect button
- Bandwidth slider -> smooth drag animation + rolling counter
- Empty state -> "No activity recorded"

---

### Help & Troubleshooting
- FAQ -> accordion with rotating caret
- Contact support -> sliding chat modal
- Offline state -> "Check your internet. Retry?"

---

## Cross-App Enhancements
- Branding: Host = Green, Connector = Blue
- Typography: Headlines 22px semi-bold, Body 16px, Captions 12px
- Iconography: Modern, consistent line weight & padding
- Illustrations: Minimal, contextual guidance

---

## Advanced UX Enhancements
- Undo actions (reject, disconnect, limit changes)
- Offline mode -> cached last-known status + recovery animation
- Multi-host vision -> placeholder: "Add another host coming soon"
- Swipe gestures -> approve/reject/reconnect
- Promising connection pop-up for Connectors -> "Connecting securely..." with animated progress ring

---

## Accessibility
- Symbols + color for status indicators (Success / Warning / Error)
- High-contrast palette for readability
- Large touch targets (>44px)
- Animations designed not to rely solely on color

---

## Gamification & Delight
- Badges -> milestones for frequent/high-speed sharing or trusted connections
- Confetti/glow bursts for first successful connection
- Progress indicators around milestones (e.g., circular rings)
- Subtle sound effects (optional toggle)

---

## Design System / UI Kit
- Buttons: default, pressed, disabled
- Input Fields: empty, active, error, focused
- Cards: Host/Connector, notifications, activity logs
- Icons: consistent size, line weight, padding
- Animation Tokens: duration, easing, stagger values
- Component Variants: platform-specific adjustments for iOS/Android

---

## Animations & Microinteractions
- Duration: 200-350ms
- Easing: natural, spring or cubic ease-in-out
- Staggered lists/cards for smooth entrance
- Microinteractions:
  - Button press -> scale / ripple
  - Status change -> fade + color transition
  - Loading -> skeleton shimmer
- Delight moments: glow bursts, progress ring, confetti

---

## Connector-Specific Feedback
- Animated connection overlay/modal -> shows progress, estimated speed/latency
- Microcopy -> "Hang tight! We are securely connecting you to [Host Name]..."
- Success -> glow burst + "Connected! [Success]"
- Error -> friendly icon + retry button

---

## Notes & Recommendations
- Onboarding: Add guided carousel + tooltip hints
- Performance feedback: Animated bandwidth/latency graphs + predictive alerts
- Undo / Recovery: Add for disconnects and limit changes
- Accessibility: Verify color-blind safe status indicators
- Gamification: Progress bar for milestones

**Status:** Complete UI/UX PRD — ready for design and development handoff.
