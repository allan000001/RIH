# airLinkRemote Internet Hotspotting (RIH) - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Purpose

1.1 Remote Internet Hotspotting (RIH) is a mobile application that allows users (hosts) to share their internet connection with friends or authorized users remotely over the internet. The connector can access the host’s internet **without consuming the host’s mobile data**, in a **secure, high-speed, and lightweight** manner.

## 2. Scope

2.1 Enable **remote internet sharing** for personal, educational, or emergency use.
2.2 Support multiple **host and connector devices** simultaneously.
2.3 Ensure **secure, encrypted connections** and bandwidth control.
2.4 Lightweight design for minimal CPU, memory, and battery usage.

## 3. Target Users

3.1 Students, remote workers, or friends who want to share internet with someone elsewhere.
3.2 Users with **internet access at host side** but limited/no access on connector side.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 User Roles

4.1.1 **Host**

* Shares internet connection.
* Approves or rejects connection requests.
* Monitors bandwidth usage and limits.

4.1.2 **Connector**

* Requests remote internet access.
* Routes all internet traffic through host.

4.1.3 **Optional Coordination Server**

* Handles peer discovery and NAT traversal for remote connections.
* Does **not relay data traffic**, maintaining high speed.

### 4.2 Core Features

4.2.1 **Remote Connection Setup**

* Connector discovers host via unique ID, friend list, or temporary code.
* Host approves connection with one-tap.
* Automatic NAT traversal for firewalls.

4.2.2 **Secure Traffic Tunnel**

* Encrypted end-to-end (VPN-style).
* Supports standard internet traffic (HTTP, HTTPS, streaming, etc.).

4.2.3 **Bandwidth Management**

* Host can set bandwidth limits per connector.
* Usage monitoring and alerts for high data usage.

4.2.4 **Connection Management**

* Host can disconnect a connector anytime.
* Connector automatically reconnects if connection drops (optional).

4.2.5 **Notifications**

* Host notified when a connector requests access.
* Connector notified when access is granted or denied.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

5.1.1 Low latency peer-to-peer connection wherever possible.
5.1.2 Lightweight app (<50MB), minimal background resource usage.

### 5.2 Security

5.2.1 End-to-end encryption for all connections.
5.2.2 Host authentication required.
5.2.3 Connector authentication via unique code or friend list.
5.2.4 Protection against unauthorized access and malware exposure.

### 5.3 Compatibility

5.3.1 Mobile platforms: Android and iOS.
5.3.2 Must work on Wi-Fi or wired internet connections.
5.3.3 Optional support for multiple connectors simultaneously.

### 5.4 Reliability

5.4.1 App should automatically handle connection drops.
5.4.2 Optional logging of connection sessions for troubleshooting.

## 6. Technical Architecture

6.1 **Components:**
6.1.1 **Host Device**: Acts as exit node for remote traffic.
6.1.2 **Connector Device**: Requests and routes traffic via encrypted tunnel through host.
6.1.3 **Coordination/Signaling Server (Optional)**: Manages peer discovery and NAT traversal.

6.2 **Traffic Flow:**

```
Connector Device → Encrypted Tunnel → Host Device → Host Internet → Public Internet
```

6.3 **Security Layer:**
6.3.1 All traffic encrypted using modern VPN protocols (WireGuard-style or TLS).
6.3.2 Authentication for all peers before establishing tunnel.

## 7. User Interface (UI)

7.1 Host dashboard: active connections, bandwidth usage, approve/reject requests.
7.2 Connector interface: request access, see status, reconnect if needed.
7.3 Optional notifications for new requests or alerts.

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

8.1 Unauthorized access → Strong authentication, unique codes, friend lists.
8.2 Bandwidth abuse → Limits per connector, usage monitoring.
8.3 Device overload → Lightweight app design, restrict simultaneous connections.
8.4 Network policy violation → App intended for personal/home networks; comply with IT rules.
8.5 NAT/firewall blocking → Coordination server for NAT traversal, automatic reconnect.

## 9. Success Metrics

9.1 Average connection latency <50ms (local) / <200ms (remote).
9.2 >90% successful connection rate.
9.3 Minimal host CPU/memory usage (<10%).
9.4 High user satisfaction with ease of setup and speed.

## 10. Future Enhancements

10.1 Support for **multiple simultaneous hosts** to improve remote access reliability.
10.2 Integration with **student ID or verified accounts** for sanctioned sharing.
10.3 Optional **compression** to increase effective bandwidth.
10.4 Mobile app analytics for performance and usage insights.
