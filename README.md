Remote Internet Sharing Made Simple, Secure & Efficient

🚀 Overview

RIH is a mobile app that lets users share their internet connection remotely — without using the host’s mobile data.
It’s secure, lightweight, and built for high-speed internet sharing between hosts and connectors over the internet.

🎯 Features

Remote Internet Sharing: Share internet securely and remotely with friends or authorized users.

Multiple Users: Supports multiple hosts and connectors simultaneously.

Secure VPN-style Tunnel: End-to-end encrypted connections for privacy.

Bandwidth Control: Hosts can set usage limits and monitor consumption.

Auto NAT Traversal: Seamless connectivity through firewalls and NAT.

Notifications: Real-time alerts for connection requests and status updates.

📱 Target Users

Students, remote workers, or friends needing internet sharing.

Users with internet access on the host side but limited/no access on the connector side.
